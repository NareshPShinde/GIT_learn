Git Cheatsheet
--------------

This cheat sheet features the foremost important and commonly used Git commands for straightforward reference. It also takes into care some of the high-level concepts of Git.¬†

Uses of Git
-----------

Git is the most widely used version control system because of the various absolute benefits offered by it :

*   Git is well known for providing the best performance when it comes to the different distributed version control systems. The operations of branching, committing, and merging are all optimized for a far better performance than other systems.
    
*   Git is employed to maintain the history and keep track of the changes in the source code files.
    
*   Git helps in independent collaborative working and allows multiple developers to collaborate and share their work.
    
*   One of Git's main benefits of Git is that it supports working in offline mode without having internet connectivity, So, just in case you have internet connectivity issues, it won't be affecting your work at all.
    
*   Git gives you the power to undo almost any command or action.
    
*   It is known to be a non-linear development due to its thousands of parallel branches.
    
*   It is scalable and provides the user to work in a distributed environment.
    
*   Git has an intermediate stage called the¬†**"staging area"**¬†where commits are often formatted, edited, and modified before completing the commit.
    
*   It is free and open source and allows the creation of a backup.
    
*   This is an industry-standard as most IDEs support Git.
    
*   Git is meant to ensure the safety and integrity of versioned content.
    
*   Each command in Git only takes some seconds to run and output results, so it saves a lot of developers' effort and time.
